Given two strings str1 and str2, find the length of shortest string that has both str1 and str2 as subsequences.

Input:   str1 = "geek",  str2 = "eke"
Output: 5
because "geeke"

Length of the shortest supersequence  = (Sum of lengths of given two strings) -
                                        (Length of LCS of two given strings)
