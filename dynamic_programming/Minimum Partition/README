Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.
If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of 
abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

same as partition problem
last part only consider dp[n][j] == true, j = 0 : sum/2
***

O(n*sum)
