This document is to explain how to use the code to find articulation points

There are two ways to input data
1. You can input data inside the code
example:
    Graph g1(5);
    g1.addEdge(1, 0);
    g1.addEdge(0, 2);
    g1.addEdge(2, 1);
    g1.addEdge(0, 3);
    g1.addEdge(3, 4);
    g1.AP();
	// input the total number of nodes in graph
	// function addEdge's parameters are the points from one edge
	// The edges have to be undirected and don't repeat the edges
	
2. You can input data from outside files by function dataFromFile(int num, string path)
	//num is the total number of nodes in graph
	//path is the file's path
example:
	    dataFromFile(7, "test.txt");

about the file's format,it should only contain edges' points
example:
0 1
1 2
2 0
1 3
1 4
1 6
3 5
4 5
	
	
	
*** make sure the graph is connected rather than separated graph	
	
	in the result:
	first line: if it is not a bi-connected graph, you can get artigulation points
	seconde line: you can get whether it is bi-connected graph or not
	third line: how many time it costs
